      "Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mThe police report states that the Mona Lisa painting is reported missing from its dedicated room in the Museum of Agadir. The report assumes that the painting has been stolen. The report also includes information about the suspects and their answers to specific questions. Rest Webber, the night guard, last checked the Mona Lisa room at 10 PM and everything was in order. SQL Sally, the curator, last accessed the room at 7 PM for a general inspection. Victor Vectors, the janitor, hasn't cleaned the room for a week.

      "1. Opportunity: Victor Vectors, the janitor, hasn't cleaned the room for a week. This means he had regular access to the room and could have had the opportunity to steal the painting without raising suspicion.\n",

      "3. Access: The police report mentions that Rest Webber, the night guard, last checked the Mona Lisa room at 10 PM and everything was in order.
